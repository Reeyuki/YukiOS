# 🖥️ Yuki OS

Yuki OS is a browser-based desktop environment that provides a unified windowed system for games, emulators, web apps, and interactive content. It integrates multiple execution runtimes into a single desktop interface, allowing different technologies to run inside one consistent environment.

Content is normalized into a single interaction model:
👉 **Click icon → content opens in a window**, regardless of runtime.
